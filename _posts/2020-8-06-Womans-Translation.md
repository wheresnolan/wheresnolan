title: August: Women in Translation Month!
---

For the past [six years](https://www.cupblog.org/2020/08/01/women-in-translation-month-2020-a-celebration-of-philosophy-and-literature/), August has been dedicated to women in translation. There are many great blogs dedicated to this cause this month as well as quite a few virtual events planned by publishers. To plug just one such series, [Fitzcarralo Editions and Charco Press](https://twitter.com/FitzcarraldoEds/status/1290348144253968384) are putting together a weekly lunch sereis of talks with the first one beginning tomorrow (08/07/2020) and focusing on translating violence.

I recently looked through my personal list of books I've read so far this year and saw that only 13 of the 55 to this point have been written by women (in translation). Although a couple of my favorite authors - Samanta Schweblin and Valeria Luiselli - are women, and two of my favorite books so far this year have been written by women - [*Monsterhuman*](https://www.dalkeyarchive.com/product/monsterhuman/) by Kjersti Skomsvold and [*On Lighthouses*](https://www.catranslation.org/shop/book/on-lighthouses/#:~:text=Equal%20parts%20personal%20memoir%20and,of%20a%20selfless%2C%20guiding%20light.&text=Jazmina%20Barrera%20was%20born%20in%20Mexico%20City%20in%201988.,-She%20was%20a) by Jazmina Barrera - these totals are still below the share of translated fiction held by women.

I always have a ton of books on my stack(s) of "to-read soon" (so many so that I often get anxiety choosing the next book). These stacks are also full of super interesting books by women. So I decided to pull a selection that I want to try to get to this month (or at least soon). I've chosen a mix of authors I've enjoyed in the past as well as a number of new voices I'm very eager to hear. The list includes a variety of some of my favorite publishers and a large number of countries as well. 

Although it's an ambitious stack to tackle this month, I want to give it a go; and if anyone wants to try any of these books with me, please just reach out and we can read together! I plan to periodically come back and update this post with my thoughts on each work as well as possibly post other interesting events or articles focusing on Women in Translation.
